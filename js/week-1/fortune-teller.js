 * ## The Lifetime Supply Calculator
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

- Store a maximum age into a variable.
- Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
- Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
- Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".
